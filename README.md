# Image_Generator_AI

This project explores **text-to-image generation** using **Machine Learning**. We use the Stable Diffusion model, an open-source state-of-the-art text-to-image generation model.

In this GitHub repository, you'll find a Python application built using *Tkinter* that utilizes *Hugging Face Diffusers* to demonstrate how to use the Stable Diffusion model. 

***The app is designed to be run on a desktop with a 4GB GPU or higher.***
